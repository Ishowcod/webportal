        <h1>Welcome to Java Codes Help</h1>
        <p> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
	    It is a general-purpose language that is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications, and web applications.	
	    Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it easier for programmers familiar with C-style languages to learn. 
	    The language is known for its portability, as Java programs can be run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, allowing for cross-platform compatibility.</p>
        
        <h2>Java Features</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java code can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming, allowing for code reusability and modularity.</li>
            <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Java has strong memory management and exception handling, making it less prone to crashes.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java provides a secure environment through its runtime environment and APIs.</li>
	    <li><strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> Java comes with a comprehensive set of libraries that facilitate various programming tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Garbage Collection:</strong> Java automatically manages memory, helping to prevent memory leaks.</li>
